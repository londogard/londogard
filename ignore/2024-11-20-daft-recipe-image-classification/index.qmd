In my previous [blog-post](/posts/2024-10-24-data-loading-daft/) I introduced Daft. Now I wish to share recipes on how to do some things.

## Loading From HuggingFace Datasets

HuggingFace Datasets is one of the biggest dataset providers out there, integrating with them is something that is of great importance. Luckily it's easy!

```python
import daft
import datasets

def load_from_hf_dataset() -> daft.DataFrame:
    ds = datasets.load_dataset("detection-datasets/fashionpedia")
    ds.table.arrow
```
