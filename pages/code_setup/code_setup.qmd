In this post I'll share my dev setup, divided into three categories.  

1. Code Editors
2. Programming Languages
3. Shell

# Code Editors Setup

I introduce my editor setups, including plugins and other things.

## VS Code

Using VS-code you'll see two common ways to initiate a project, either using (1) raw settings or a (2) devcontainer.  
The containerized approach is really cool because it gives the same environment independing on hardware as it's Docker.

### VS Code Settings

All these files are located in `.vscode` as suggested by filename.


::: {#tbl-panel layout-ncol=2}

```{.json include=".vscode/extensions.json" filename=".vscode/extensions.json"}
```

```{.json include=".vscode/settings.json" filename=".vscode/settings.json"}
```
:::

### devcontainer

```{.json include=".devcontainer/devcontainer.json" filename=".devcontainer/devcontainer.json"}
```

## Jetbrains

### Extensions

- Ruff
- [color highlighter](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13309-color-highlighter)
- [Rainbow CSV](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12896-rainbow-csv)

# Programming Languages Setup

And setup on specific programming languages.

## Python

```{.yaml include="env.yml" filename="env.yml"}
```

## Kotlin

Using Gradle, Kotlin is awesome with stdlib! :)

# Shell

- [starship.rs](https://starship.rs/) - The minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell!
