# Marimo

Marimo is the "new" kid on the block. Based on what Marimo tries to achieve you can't help yourself but comparing it too other frameworks such as *Gradio, Jupyter, Streamlit, Solara & Panel*.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
# A multitude of options

**The fact that there's a plethora of options** to build WASM apps/tools and "*literate programming"* through notebook-style **is nothing short of amazing**\
We're in for a great time!

Drawback? What do I choose!
:::

I'll put a little focus on comparing, especially their WASM usage via [pyodide](https://pyodide.org/), where I the first time wrote about [stlite](https://stlite.net/) in my [blog](https://blog.londogard.com/posts/2024-02-22-stlite/)  (Feb, 2024). Since I discovered WASM deployments via *base64-URLs* and *standalone-HTML-file* I was amazed at the opportunity to deploy simple-to-use tools for your colleagues. 

Marimo is a reactive notebook with built-in UI components that can be turned into an app easily. It tries to become great at additional battles, such as WASM.

### My Final Thoughts
_Marimo does great, it handles App use-case, Notebook and WASM phenomenally._ The UI components are sleek and combines in a smooth way. The one draw-back? You'll have to rewire your brain a bit with _reactivity_ rather than sequential execution!

## Usage

I'll start by sharing **my current go-to tool(s)** for each area of use, and then try to fit Marimo into this.

- **Heavy Applications**: [Solara](https://solara.dev/) 
    - Pros: 'React' style of programming, very efficient bindings and updates
    - Cons: Not the most modern UI, 

- **Simple Applications**: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) 
    - Pros: Simple, Modern UI, Large Community
    - Cons: The "execute everything on each change" execution is quite inefficient and with caching reasoning grows harder with time
- **WASM Apps**: Streamlit via stlite
- **ML Demos with API**: Gradio (and Streamlit)
    - Pros: Simple, provides `gradio_client` REST API by default (AMAZING)
    - Cons: I hate building Gradio apps
- **Notebook**: Jupyter


_Marimo could possibly replace most in the list_, but especially WASM Apps and Notebook. Potentially it can take on ML Demos and Simple Applications too, and why not Heavy?

Marimo is perhaps too bold at trying to achieve it all, let's dive into it!

## WASM Details on each tool
- `stlite` can be deploy as single HTML file, but depends on network then (fetching CDN resources).
- `marimo` can be deployed as a HTML folder that needs to be server, but requires no network.
- `stlite`, `marimo`, and `py.cafe` all enable "base64-url-apps", i.e. you can have a single URL that contains the full application and can run on their webpage!
- `jupyterlite` is really good as a tool, but the share-ability is awful.
- `gradio` works decently in WASM, but it has a big pro which is its API when running the real app. The - `gradio_client` is an amazing initiative.
  
All in all I'm amazed regarding the tools that are available to run sandboxed in your browser (all based on [pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/)). We're programming in a really cool part of history!

:::

If we put scores on each (3,2,1 for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd) we end up with the following:

1. **Marimo & Streamlit:** **8pts**

2. **Solara:** 6pts

3. **Jupyter & Gradio:** 5pts

It seems Marimo ends up covering all needs quite well based on my initial research.  
Streamlit ends up in the top because of its strong community, and `stlite` really helps the WASM story-line. 

But how do you actually use Marimo, ***and can it beat Streamlit by having a smarter execution system?***


## Marimo Intro

Marimo has two execution "environments", Python and WASM.

### Python

This is essentially like running a Jupyter Notebook in your local python environment. It starts a marimo kernel that handles your execution:

```
marimo edit # open marimo editor and app
```

### WASM

Running in a sandboxed Python (pyodide) environment *inside* your browser! ðŸ¤¯

I'm amazed at how easy you can share "tools" with internal teams today using WASM. 

1. A single HTML file without serving needs (Ã¡ la `stlite`, utilizing CDN assets)
2. A single URL that contains the code using base64-encoded string in the URL (Ã¡ la `stlite`, `py.cafe`, and `marimo`)
3. A stand-alone web app (folder with HTML file and assets) that you serve

It's such an easy way to deploy tools, and everything is sandboxed inside the browser. No need to go through IT security or have an deployment done - an amazing feat!

#### Marimo WASM
Marimo solves WASM quite brilliantly. Their built-in package handler makes it a breeze to add dependencies.  
The app looks just the same, compared to say `gradio` that degrades quite a lot with `gradio_lite`.

Finally as shared in the margin the resources used by Marimo is in the lower span compared to other similar apps.


# Marimo

Marimo is easy, you simply define and use a component like following:
```python
# cell 1
import marimo as mo
slider = mo.ui.slider(0,10)
f"Select your step: {slider}"
---
# cell 2
f"You've selected {slider.value} which doubled is {slider.value * 2}"
```

Here we defined a slider component, we display it using markdown and in our second cell 
it's neatly displayed and updated automatically because of reactivity!  
Bonus? You can swap the order of the cells and the code will still be valid, because of said reactivity. This is also what enforces the _reproducibility_. The code follows a DAG based on the variables.  
Drawback? You can't update a variable outside the cell that defines it.

## A basic App Example

I'll share examples from [docs.marimo.io](https://docs.marimo.io/#a-reactive-programming-environment) which is a great resource to get started.

**UI Components:**  
![Marimo Slider & Reactivity](https://docs.marimo.io/_static/readme-ui.mp4) 

**DataFrame Explorer:**  
![Marimo DataFrame Explorer - I love it!](https://docs.marimo.io/_static/docs-df.mp4)\
**SQL Mixin**  
![Mixing DataFrame's and SQL in Marimo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marimo-team/marimo/main/docs/_static/readme-sql-cell.png) 

**Plotting Callbacks**  
![Embedding Selection Callback](https://cms.marimo.io/landing/3.mp4) 


**Standouts:**

1. Deterministic Execution Order (annoying but helpful)
    1. It's a tad bit confusing to have it possible to have cells in random order, but **at least it's reproducible** compared to Jupyter!
1. Built-in Package Management (especially handy for WASM)
1. Pretty elements for a notebook (comparing with ipywidgets..)
    1. What's even cooler is that you can easily combine UI components in a markdown string. Making a seamless flow!

## Marimo Editor

While the editor is excellent I found it quite poor in picking up local project files outside the script itself for auto-completion. This is where [watching](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/editor_features/watching/) helps:

```
marimo edit --watch 
```

\
Which enables editing in your local IDE and watch changes in the browser. I think this is a nice balance where you can opt to edit directly in IDE or in browser depending on your current need. But VS Code / PyCharm's built in Notebooks are unbeatable in the User Experience (i.e. Autocompletion + Visualization)! ðŸ¤“ 

**If Marimo could pick up IntelliSense from the IDE that'd be a great improvement!** Marimo handles "project" IntelliSense especially poor.


## Marimo Gotchas

There's a few things one need to think about when developing a Marimo app/notebook.

### Reactive Execution

The reactive nature of Marimo makes it reproducible, but building Apps with reactive execution makes it simple to accidentally "trigger" actions when you didn't anticipate to. Especially as you might be used to Jupyter and not having "auto-run".

**Fixes:**

1. Set expensive/dangerous actions behind a button (define it in a function)
2. Apply `mo.stop` to stop execution.
3. Disable cell ([example](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/reactivity/#disabling-cells))
4. Make "lazy execution" of cell or all cells. This will neatly gray cells that are out-of-sync

### UI vs root namespace

Marimo mixes `mo.ui.\*` and `mo.\*` namespace for different things.

`mo.ui.\*` includes reactive UI components, e.g. button & slider, while `mo.\*` includes display UI components such as image or video.

This is quite confusing and I think the namespacing issue is a larger one than one might anticipate, as you tend to get lost on where to find what you wish to draw.

What's cool though is that, just like Jupyter, Marimo tries to auto-display element using nice visualization.


### Only final element is visible

Only the final component added is actually displayed, in my opinion all `mo.ui` components should be displayed if they're added. It'd make more sense.

One can wrap elements inside a markdown text, accordion or other type of "display multiple elements".

# Outro
I think Marimo all in all does really well, there's a few sharp edges to resolve but I might replace Jupyter really soon with this. The DataFrame Explorer - Amazing. The callbacks for charts and more - Superb!

It's like a harder-to-reason but better Streamlit if that makes sense? With more components it'll be golden!
