- **Interests (-tech)**: brewing beer, home automation, traveling, climate, and family/friends

### Introduction

I’m passionate about transforming ML and data R&D into real products. By combining software engineering with data science, I help build robust systems grounded in MLOps and DataOps principles. This help the team ship safer iterations faster and focus on high-impact outcomes.

Since my university days I’ve loved enabling others through mentoring, better tooling (developer experience), and knowledge sharing. That motivation has grown over time, and I’m now looking for a Lead/Manager role (again) where I can help foster a great team dynamic that balances research with engineering and trust.

**Core strengths**

- R&D → production: turning prototypes into reliable, maintainable systems with clear ownership
- ML platforms & applied ML: data infrastructure, CV/time-series/NLP, deployment and operationalization
- Engineering leadership: team lead, hiring, mentoring, and stakeholder alignment

### Other Experiences
