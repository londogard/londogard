### Introduction

I'm in love with data of small and big sizes, with passion of sharing knowledge you'll find me keeping up-to-date and a great explainer.  
In the end what excites me the most is to build actual value by finding patterns in data. I work in a unified way of Software Engineering with Data Science/Engineering to keep code tidy, scalable and efficient. The systems I build have a lot of ML-/DataOps in mind. This allows the team to put more effort into how the model is used (context) and how it impacts downstream consumers. Being able to iterate fast in a reckless way while being safe is incredibly valuable.

## Work Experience


### **AFRY**: _Team Lead Analytics_
Built a AI & Analytics subdivision from scratch at AFRY X where I handled everything from 1:1's to recruitment and sales. I helped bring in assignments and handled communication, made sure our solutions was of high quality.  
Additionally I supervised 5 Master Thesises in co-operation with Apple (Maps).

**Apple Maps** _Lead and Data Engineer/Scientist_ (2023)  
I managed the delivery of a AI team of 6, and the client relationship. We built a scalable web scraping solution using XGBoost and LLM's, e.g. RoBERTa, which was deployed in production using Scala/Spark. Further we integrated MLOps solutions and explainable AI (XAI) into the training pipelines.  
Tech: Python, Scala, Spark, PyTorch, sklearn, SHAP, MLFlow

**Volvo Cars** _Lead and Data Engineer/Scientist_ (2022-2023)   
After bringing assignment to AFRY I was delivery manager.  
The assignment itself was two feasibility studies where we built a generic pipeline on Timeseries Classification/Forecasting. Using this we compared State-of-the-Art models such as Informer & NHiTS and integrate MLOps principles.  
The data was 40 KHz sensor data and in both assignments we presented and had a Q&A with the Agile Release Train at VCC.  
Tech: Python, Docker, Azure, PyTorch, sklearn, SHAP    

**Norsk Hydro**  _Data Scientist_  (2023)  
Task: Reduce amount of scrap produced in factories.  
Approach: Machine Learning to model producers and apply Swarm Optimization, with additional analysis applied.  
Tech: sklearn, XGBoost, XAI (SHAP), Docker, Azure, MLFlow

**Öresundsbron**  _Data Warehouse & Cloud Expert_  (2023)   
- Create a tendering (upphandling) on how Öresundsbron should collect, store and work with data
- Tech: Cloud Data Platform (Databricks/Snowflake), Realtime Warnings (TimeScaleDB)

**Ericsson**  _Lead and Data Scientist_  (2021-2023)  
- Manage delivery of AI team and customer relation                                              
- Brough assignment in

- 5G antenna Q&A process improvements, find patterns and behaviours in sensor data (time-series)
- End-2-end interactive validation tool with integrated Machine Learning                        
- Tech: PyTorch, sklearn, streamlit, Docker, Azure, GitLab Pipelines
