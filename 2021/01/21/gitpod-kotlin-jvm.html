<h1 id="gitpod---your-editor-in-the-cloud">GitPod - your editor in the cloud</h1>
<p><a href="https://gitpod.io/">GitPod.io</a> is a editor in the cloud based on <a href="https://theia-ide.org/">Theia</a> which is a IDE built for the cloud &amp; desktop. 
It implements the same language servers and allow you to use the same extensions as in VS Code - which is great.</p>

<p>For more about GitPod and how to combine it with languages such as Kotlin, Java &amp; more, read üëá.</p>

<h3 id="what">What</h3>
<p><a href="https://gitpod.io/">GitPod.io</a> from the start worked for the normal ‚Äúlow-barrier‚Äù languages such as JavaScript &amp; Python and still works great, and it really is where it excels. 
Lately though they‚Äôve stepped up and added more &amp; more targets with further customization.</p>

<p>You can now:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Customize your docker build by installing new packages (through <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apt install</code>).</li>
  <li>Customize your extensions (majority, if not all, from VS Code available)</li>
  <li>Add VNC (see native desktop programs)</li>
  <li>Prebuilt containers (save a lot of time to not rebuild everything each time)</li>
  <li>‚Ä¶ &amp; more</li>
</ul>

<p>With a free account you get 50h / month of time to use this (as of 2021-01-22), which is very kind of GitPod!</p>

<h3 id="how">How</h3>
<p>First of all you need either a GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket account. Once that is done you need to find a repository that you want to work on, it can be both a private or public repository.</p>

<p>Once you‚Äôve got your account &amp; repository set up then head to gitpod.io/#{Repository: e.g. https://github.com/londogard/snake-js-jvm-native} and it will open up. 
This will ask you to create a PR with some new config adding a new file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitpod.yml</code> and further you can add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitpod.Dockerfile</code> which configures your Docker setup.</p>

<p><strong>Setting up <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitpod.yml</code>:</strong></p>
<div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">image</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="na">file</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">.gitpod.Dockerfile</span> <span class="c1"># OBS: only use this if you have a custom image</span>

<span class="c1"># List the ports you want to expose and what to do when they are served. See https://www.gitpod.io/docs/config-ports/</span>
<span class="na">ports</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">port</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="m">3000</span>
    <span class="na">onOpen</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">open-preview</span>

<span class="c1"># List the start up tasks. You can start them in parallel in multiple terminals. See https://www.gitpod.io/docs/config-start-tasks/</span>
<span class="na">tasks</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">init</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">./gradlew clean build</span>

<span class="na">vscode</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="na">extensions</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">random.extension</span> <span class="c1"># (automatically added by adding extensions through interface). </span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Setting up <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitpod.Docker</code>:</strong></p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>FROM gitpod/workspace-full-vnc  # For NoVNC to work

USER gitpod

RUN sudo apt-get -q update &amp;&amp; \
    sudo apt-get install -y libgtk-3-dev &amp;&amp; \ # For NoVNC to work
    sudo apt-get install -yq gcc-multilib &amp;&amp; \
    sudo apt install -y libtinfo5 &amp;&amp; \ # For Kotlin Native to work
    sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this setup you can push the changes to your repo and re-open the GitPod to reload a brand new Docker image with the updated packages.</p>

<p>This configuration allows you to do all I‚Äôve mentioned such as running Native Kotlin, run with VNC to view native application windows and more!<br />
By default you‚Äôre able to view a in-place/preview browser window so doing web development is working from the get-go and as such also Kotlin/JS worked pretty well without any configuration.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre wondering, the NoVNC is on port 6080.</p>

<h3 id="why">Why</h3>
<p>For me there‚Äôs actually not just one reason to why I‚Äôd like to do this.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Be able to do some quick coding / reviewing on my tablet.</li>
  <li>Workshops at AFRY (no installation required for users)</li>
</ol>

<p>Just in a few days (2021-01-26) I‚Äôll do a workshop at AFRY with Kotlin Multiplatform where GitPod.io will be a great alternative for colleagues who have computers 
where they‚Äôre not allowed to install their own applications.</p>

<h3 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">GitHub Codespaces</a> is coming, but is still in a private BETA.</li>
  <li>VS Code Remote (<strong>obs</strong> this actually require your own computer somewhere to host the vs code server)</li>
</ul>

<p>I think for now GitPod.io is the simplest and best out of them, unless you have your own computer to use as a server for VS Code Remote!</p>

<p>Thanks<br />
