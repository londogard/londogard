Back in action and finalizing the baby monitor!üë∂

**TL;DR**
Built a baby monitor that included the following features:

1. Bidirectional Audio & Unidirectional Video (Night & Day Vision!)
2. Temperature Sensor
3. Motor (Servo) to move left/right & up/down

The project was born the day I met an old friend and saw his expensive baby monitor that he had been gifted, I needed to match it! ü§ì

**Result:**

I'm very happy about the results, my wife asked me to draw a smile on the creepy monitor, hence the smile! üòú
Video of it running live can be found at the end!

## Implementation Details

To implement and build this camera I had to combine both hardware and software into a package.

### Hardware Details

Most of my hardware was bought through Aliexpress, with few parts being from an old Pi.

### Software Stack

To make use of my beautiful hardware I need software!
Keeping things simple (KISS) I decided to use a Python backend and show it through a simple webapp. That way I can view the baby monitor from my PC, Smartphone & anything that has a browser really.

The end result became as follows üëá
![](20230206201818.png)

#### Webapp Client

Over all I really enjoyed playing around with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). It felt very straight-forward and simple, although there's less community and libraries compared to [React](https://reactjs.org/).
All in all I'd give it one up compared to React because of simplicity, but I'm just a ordinary Backend Dev / Data Engineer+Scientist.

#### Server/Backend

[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) as always is a blessing to work with! The auto-generated swagger page, superb type integration and much more makes me feel right at home as someone who's really a Scala-dev.üòâ
FastAPI has its drawbacks though, the streaming component definitely showed some rather large overhead. I had to fall back to raw http to have good performance üò∞

The end result became two backends, but I tried to keep the responsibilities clear and it worked out fine!

## End Result

And a video to show how real-time it is!

I'm very happy about the results!

## A sad ending

The servo motors showed to be too weak which interestingly means they're too strong.
As they try to move the housing it works slowly until it move everything at once which creates a force stronger than the pad that the monitor was standing on.

The end result was... Sweet release of machine breakage üò¢
